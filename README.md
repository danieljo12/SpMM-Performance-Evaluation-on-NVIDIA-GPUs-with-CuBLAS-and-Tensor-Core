This code is a CUDA-based C++ program that uses the cuBLAS library to perform Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) on the GPU. The program specifically uses FP16 (half-precision floating-point) matrices to leverage the GPU's tensor cores for optimized performance in matrix operations. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

### Key Libraries and Headers
- **cuBLAS**: The CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms library is used here to perform matrix-matrix multiplication on the GPU.
- **CUDA Runtime**: Manages CUDA operations, memory allocations, and kernel launches.
- **CUDA Events**: Measures time for performance benchmarking.

### Inputs and Command-Line Arguments
The program expects either three or four command-line arguments:
1. **M_GLOBAL**: Number of rows in Matrix A and the output matrix.
2. **K_GLOBAL**: Number of columns in Matrix A and rows in Matrix B.
3. **N_GLOBAL**: Number of columns in Matrix B and the output matrix.
4. **Sparsity (optional)**: Percentage of sparsity in Matrix A (defaults to 0 if not provided).

### Program Breakdown
1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Allocates space for matrices \( A \) and \( B \) on the host (CPU) and device (GPU).
   - Matrix **A** is in row-major format, while Matrix **B** is in column-major format for optimized cuBLAS usage.

2. **Data Initialization**:
   - `init_host_matrices` function initializes host matrices \( A \) and \( B \), potentially applying a pruning percentage to create a sparse matrix.

3. **Transfer Data to GPU**:
   - Copies matrices \( A \) and \( B \) from host memory to device memory, allowing operations to be performed on the GPU.

4. **CuBLAS Setup and Execution**:
   - Initializes cuBLAS handle and sets the stream to default.
   - Sets math mode:
     - `CUBLAS_PEDANTIC_MATH`: Disables Tensor Cores.
     - `CUBLAS_DEFAULT_MATH`: Enables Tensor Cores.
   - Performs **Matrix Multiplication** using `cublasGemmEx`:
     - **alpha** and **beta** are scaling factors for the product of \( A \) and \( B \).
     - `CUBLAS_OP_T`: Transposes matrix \( A \).
     - Results are stored in `D_cublas`.

5. **Benchmarking**:
   - **Warm-Up Phase**: Ensures initial performance stabilization by running matrix multiplication a few times.
   - **Benchmark Phase**: Measures execution time and calculates TFLOPS.
   - Time is measured using CUDA events, and performance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{TFLOPS} = \frac{2 \times M \times N \times K}{\text{Execution Time in Seconds}} \times 10^{12}
     \]

6. **Output and Cleanup**:
   - Copies the result back to host memory.
   - Prints matrix dimensions, sparsity, and performance metrics.
   - Frees all allocated memory on both host and device.

### Key Functions
- **cublasGemmEx**: Used to perform general matrix multiplication on the GPU with options for precision (here, FP16).
- **cudaEventRecord / cudaEventElapsedTime**: Measures execution time between CUDA events, useful for benchmarking GPU performance.

### Performance Measurement
The program benchmarks two scenarios:
- **Without Tensor Cores** (pedantic math mode).
- **With Tensor Cores** (default math mode).

The TFLOPS achieved in each case are outputted, allowing comparisons of tensor core acceleration for SpMM on the given matrices.

### Error Handling
The program checks for memory allocation errors on both CPU and GPU. Additionally, each call to `cublasGemmEx` includes error checking for potential cuBLAS API errors.

### Summary
This code is a high-performance benchmarking tool for sparse matrix multiplications on GPUs. It leverages tensor cores for enhanced performance on FP16 data, which is particularly useful for deep learning and scientific applications. The program reports on matrix size and computational performance, allowing users to analyze how tensor cores impact SpMM execution.
